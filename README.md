# object_detection_yolo
A Object Detection Model In Python Detect real-time objects (like people, cars, etc.) using webcam
# 🧠 Real-Time Object Detection App with YOLOv5

This project uses **YOLOv5** (You Only Look Once) with **OpenCV** and **PyTorch** to perform real-time object detection on webcam/video feed. It can detect multiple objects like people, cars, animals, and more — using pre-trained models on the COCO dataset.
